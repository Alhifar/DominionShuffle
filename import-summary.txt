ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .hgignore
* .hgtags
* graphics\
* graphics\andominion_menu_icons.zip
* graphics\clear_all.psd
* graphics\coin_token.xcf
* graphics\embargo_token.xcf
* graphics\icon.psd
* graphics\island_mat.xcf
* graphics\last_result.psd
* graphics\last_result_compact.psd
* graphics\listicons.psd
* graphics\min_exclude_all.psd
* graphics\minmax.psd
* graphics\pirate_ship_mat.xcf
* graphics\potion.xcf
* graphics\require_all.psd
* graphics\shuffle.psd
* graphics\tablimits.psd
* graphics\tabselect.psd
* graphics\tabshuffle.psd
* graphics\village_mat.xcf

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
