++ Version 1.10 ++\n
Added ability to draw more or less than 10 cards.\n
Don\'t draw Potions, Ruins, Spoils, or Supplementary cards (e.g. Madman for Hermit) - These aren\'t needed in the App, as you should know to grab them when you pull out the other card.\n
Disabled Card Language Selector (since it\'s currently broken, apologies again to non-English speakers).\n
Moved both of the above options into a single Settings area.\n
Added Default Settings of: All Cards included. Maximum of 2 Events. Will only be set if the App is started with no pre-existing data.\n
Remove Shuffle from Menu - Should be accessed from the Shuffle Tab.\n

Non-English Languages are not working (Sorry).\n
Forcibly selecting a non-Kingdom Card (e.g. Potion, Platinum, Shelters, an Event, etc.) sometimes results in more or less than 10 actual Kingdom cards being drawn.
